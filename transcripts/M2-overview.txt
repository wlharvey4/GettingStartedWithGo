#+AUTHOR: Ian Harris

Welcome to the  second module.

We're going to  start talking a little  bit more detail about  the Go language,
we'll talk about datatypes in Go, the basic data types. That's what this module
is  really about.

We'll go  over data  types you've  seen in  other languages,  integers, floats,
booleans, strings, variations, all those.  So, you can change the length of the
integer, length of the  flow, things like this. So we'll  talk about those data
types, we'll  talk specifically about how  to declare them, how  to create them
and what functions are  available for them. So what functions  can you apply to
integers? What  functions can you  apply to  strings and booleans  and floatss?

Once you're done with this, you'll be  able to use basic data types inside your
Go code.
